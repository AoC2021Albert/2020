# adventofcode2020
Code used to solve adventofcode.com for Christmas 2020.

Look at your own risk. The code here has the goal of solving a problem. No attempt to make it nice or elegant has been done. Also, often I process the input file with sed or any other shell commands to have it easier to process in Python.
